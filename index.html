                        This project demonstrates a streamlined and automated approach to deploying containerized flask application using a 
                        combination of GitHub Actions, k3s, and ArgoCD. It provides a complete DevOps workflow for building, pushing, 
                        and deploying Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster.

                            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                            <li>
                                GitHub Actions for CI/CD: Leveraging GitHub Actions, this project automates the Continuous Integration
                                (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes. It includes a CI pipeline that builds Docker images 
                                and a CD pipeline for deploying applications.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Docker Hub Integration: The CI pipeline builds Docker images for the application and pushes them 
                                to Docker Hub, making the images available for deployment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                k3s Kubernetes Cluster: This project utilizes k3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution,
                                to create and manage the Kubernetes cluster. k3s is ideal for development, testing, and lightweight 
                                production environments.
                            </li>

                                GitOps with ArgoCD: ArgoCD is employed for GitOps-style application deployment. It continuously 
                                monitors a Git repository for application configurations, ensuring that the desired state matches
                                the actual state in the cluster.

                            <h4 class="bd-grid">Why This Project Matters:</h4>
                            This project exemplifies the power of automation in modern software development. It showcases how 
                            using GitHub Actions, Docker, k3s, and ArgoCD can streamline and enhance the development and deployment
                            processes. The use of GitOps principles ensures consistency and traceability in application deployment 
                            across different environments.

                        Conferences and conventions are hotspots for making connections. Professionals in attendance often share the same 
                        interests and can make valuable business and personal connections with one another. At the same time, these events 
                        draw a large crowd and it's often hard to make these connections in the midst of all of these events' excitement and energy.
                        To help attendees make connections, we are building the infrastructure for a service that can inform attendees if
                        they have attended the same booths and presentations at an event.

                        <h4 class="bd-grid">GOAL:</h4>
                        <p>
                        I work for a company that is building an app that uses location data from mobile devices. 
                        My company has built a POC application to ingest location data named UdaTracker. This POC was built 
                        with the core functionality of ingesting location and identifying individuals who have shared a close 
                        geographic proximity.

                        Management loved the POC so now that there is buy-in, they want to enhance this application.
                        I was tasked to enhance the POC application into a MVP to handle the large volume of 
                        location data that will be ingested.

                        To do so, I refactored the application into a microservice architecture using message passing
                        techniques. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the countless optimizations and changes that can be made: 
                        my priority was to approach the task as an architect and refactor the application into 
                        microservices.

                    <div class="bd-grid">
                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        Security is a highly dynamic topic with ever changing threats and priorities. Newsworthy topics
                        ranging from fortune 500 companies like Garmin paying $10 million in ransom for ransomware attacks
                        to supply chain attacks such as Solarwinds are ever-present.
                        
                        Security is becoming harder as the velocity of deployments is accelerating. The Synopsis 2020 Open
                        Source Security Risk Analysis Report revealed that 99% of audited code bases contained open source, 
                        and within those codebases 75% of vulnerabilities were left unpatched, creating risk. 
                        Incorporating security checks into each step of the build and deployment process is vital to 
                        identify security defects before they hit production.
                        
                        Our company CTO is worried about what our engineering team is doing to harden and monitor the 
                        company's new microservice application against malicious threat actors and payloads. In response to
                        the CTOs concerns I will threat model, build and harden a microservices environment.
                        
                        <h4>Goal</h4>
                        I was presented with the challenge to build a secure Microservice environment, threat modeling
                        and hardening the container image, run-time environment and application itself. For purposes of the
                        project, I was instructed to use a secure base opensuse image, covering considerations for the 
                        importance of using trustworthy base images and verifing the baseline. I was provided with 
                        instructions to build, harden, ship and run an environment analogous to the company's new 
                        microservice application, simplified for project purposes. In the project I will define and build a 
                        new environment from the ground-up.
                        
                        In a real-world scenario, I may have an existing envrionment that needs to be hardened or may 
                        decided to re-build parts or all net-new, regardless, the tools and techniques in the project are 
                        directly applicable. The beauty of microservices vs a monolith architecture is that all core components
                        (image, container, run-time, application) are abstracted allowed for isolation boundaries and iterative 
                        development. In the real-world, I could choose to harden and redeploy all base-images as one project 
                        phase and tackle docker container security, kubernetes hardening and the software composition anaylsis, 
                        as individual project phases. The best approach is to bake these requirements and security hardening into
                        the build and deploy process. In an enterprise setting, much of this can be enforced with security units 
                        test via CI/CD prior to deployment. Hardening the base-image and baking security into the CI/CD is beyond 
                        the scope of this project.
                        
                        For this project, once the Microservice environment is hardened and provisioned, I configured sysdig 
                        Falco to perform run-time monitoring on the node, sending logs to a Grafana node for visualization. 
                        To demonstrate to the CTO that the company can respond to a real security event, I simulated a 
                        tabletop cyber exercise by running a script to introduce an unknown binary from the starter code that
                        disrupt the environment!
                        
                        My goal was to evaluate Grafana to determine what the unknown binary is, contain and remediate the 
                        environment, write an incident response report and present it to the CTO.
